"""R7.2/R7.3 — the isolation boundary, and an honest account of what it enforces.

The rule this module exists to keep: **a timeout is not isolation**, and neither is
a timeout plus resource limits. A Python process on the same host can read the
application's files, its database, its configuration, and write to any of them.
So execution here is not "run a subprocess"; it is a *boundary*, built from kernel
primitives, whose guarantees are declared, checked, and reported with every result.

What the boundary enforces, and how each is proven rather than asserted:

* **no network** -- a network namespace, so an outbound connection fails at the
  syscall. Proven by opening a socket to a real address and requiring failure.
* **an isolated filesystem** -- a mount namespace plus a private root: a tmpfs
  becomes `/`, the language runtime is bind-mounted into it *read-only*, and
  exactly two directories are writable (`/workspace`, `/tmp`). The host tree is
  not hidden behind a flag; it is absent, because it was never mounted into the
  new root. Proven by opening a host path for writing and then checking the host
  filesystem for the file.
* **a separate PID namespace** -- the program is PID 1 of its own tree, `/proc`
  shows only that tree, and the kernel reaps the whole namespace when it exits.
* **resource ceilings** -- address space, CPU seconds and file size are applied by
  the child to itself before any of the program is compiled, so they hold for
  everything it spawns.

What it does **not** enforce is stated as plainly, because the one thing a sandbox
must never do is overstate itself: there is no **aggregate** memory ceiling. The
per-process `RLIMIT_AS` multiplied by the process ceiling is the worst case, and
that product is computed and reported on every run (`aggregate_memory_bound_mb`)
instead of being left for the reader to work out. A true tree-wide limit needs
cgroup v2, and this module does not claim one -- `detect()` reports the boundary it
can actually build, and a host that cannot build it gets no execution at all.

The threat model is stated here so it is not implied: the boundary defends against
arbitrary code *reaching or modifying anything outside its workspace*. It is not a
defence against a kernel exploit, and it is not a claim that a process holding
`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` inside its own user namespace is harmless -- only that nothing
worth reaching is inside the root it can see.

Nothing here reads the deployment's environment or names a host: the boundary is
described by what it can do, and the caller passes in what it needs. That is also
what `tests/test_agent_no_platform_branching.py` enforces for every module in this
package.
