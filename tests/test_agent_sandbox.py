"""R7 — the isolation boundary, tested by trying to break it.

The claim this file defends is narrow and checkable: *code execution in this
repository either runs inside a boundary that denies the network, hides the host
filesystem, scrubs the environment and caps time, memory, processes and output --
or it does not run at all.*

So these tests do not read the capability set and nod. They attempt the things the
boundary forbids: opening a host file for writing and then checking the host for
the file, connecting to a real address, reading the parent's environment,
allocating past the ceiling, forking past the process cap, writing past the file
size cap, looping past the deadline, spawning a helper that would outlive the
kill. A boundary that stops them is proven; one that only says it would is caught
here.

Two intentional asymmetries:

* The refusal path is tested unconditionally, because "no boundary" and "a partial
  boundary" must both fail closed on every machine.
* The enforcement tests skip with a printed reason where the kernel forbids user
  namespaces. A skip is visible in the CI log rather than passing silently, and a
  dedicated step in the workflow prints which of the two the runner gives -- a
  suite that quietly stops proving isolation is the failure this file exists to
  prevent.
